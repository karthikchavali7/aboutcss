    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets, fontaly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplyfy the process of making web page presentable</li>
            <li>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background image or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects</li>
            <li>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Advantages of CSS</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>CSS saves time-</b> can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many web pages as you want</li>
            <li><b>Pages load faster-</b> if you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule for a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So, less code means faster download times</li>
            <li><b>Easy Maintenance-</b> to make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically</li>
            <li><b>Superior Style to HTML-</b> CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes</li>
            <li><b>Global web standards-</b> now HTML attributes are being deprecated, and it is being recommended to use CSS</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>CSS Version</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets, level 1 (CSS1) was came out of W3C as a recommendation in December 1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model for all the HTML tags</li>
            <li>CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds support for media-specific style sheets (e.g., printers and aural devices), downloadable fonts, elements positioning, and tables</li>
            <li>The earliest CSS3 drafts were published in June 1999</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Maintenance of CSS</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. The CSS working group creates documents called specifications. When a specification has been discussed and officially ratified by W3C members, it becomes a recommendation</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Types of CSS</h1>
    <p>There are four ways to associate styles with your HTML document. The most commonly used methods are inline CSS and external CSS</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Embedded CSS-</b> You can put your CSS rules into an HTML document using the style element. This tag is placed inside the head tag. Rules defined using this syntax will be applied to all the elements available in the document</li>
        <li><b>Inline CSS-</b> You can use the style attribute of any HTML element to define style rules. These rules will be applied to that element only</li>
        <li><b>External CSS-</b> The link element can be used to link an external stylesheet file to your HTML document. An external style sheet is a separate text file with a .css extension. You define all the style rules within this text file and then include this file in any HTML document using the link element</li>
        <li><b>Import CSS-</b> @import is used to import an external stylesheet in a manner similar to the link element</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Priority of CSS Styles</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Inline CSS</li>
        <li>Embedded CSS</li>
        <li>Imported CSS</li>
        <li>External CSS</li>
    </ol>
